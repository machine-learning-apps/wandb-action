inputs:
  WANDB_API_KEY:
    description: your W&B api key.
    required: true
  PROJECT_NAME:
    description: The entity/project name associated with your wandb project.  Example - 'github/predict-issue-labels'
    required: true
  RUN_ID:
    description: the run id, which can be found in the url https://app.wandb.ai/{entity_name}/{project_name}/runs/{run_ID}.  When supplying this input, FILTER_GITHUB_SHA and FILTER_SECONDARY_SHA are ignored and only the run corresponding to this id (along with any baselines corresponding to the input BASELINE_TAGS) are returned.
  FILTER_GITHUB_SHA:
    description: The git SHA that you want to filter runs by.  This assumes you have a logged a configuration variable named 'github_sha' to your runs. A common usage pattern is to supply the built-in environment variable $GITHUB_SHA, to get the commit SHA that triggered the workflow.  Note that this argument is ignored if RUN_ID is specified.
    require: false
  FILTER_SECONDARY_SHA:
    description: This is an optional field you can filter your runs by.  This assumes you have logged a configuration variable named 'secondary_sha' to your model runs.  You might use this field for data versioning.  Note that this argument is ignored if RUN_ID is specified.
    require: false
    default: ""
  BASELINE_TAGS:
    description: A list of tags that correspond to runs you want to retrieve in addition to those that correspond to the FILTER_GITHUB_SHA.  You would typically use this field to obtain baseline runs to compare your current runs against.  Example - "['baseline']"
    require: false
    default: "[]"
  DISPLAY_METRICS:
    description: A list of summary metrics you want to retain for the csv file that is written to the actions environment.  Example - "['acc', 'loss', 'val_acc', 'val_loss']"
    require: false
    default: "[]"
  DISPLAY_CONFIG_VARS:
    description: A list of configuration variables you want to retain for the csv file written to the actions environment.  Example - "['learning_rate', 'num_layers']"
    require: false
    default: "[]"
  DEBUG:
    description: Setting this variable to any value will turn debug mode on.
    require: false
    default: ""
outputs:
  BOOL_COMPLETE:
    description: True if there is at least 1 finished run and no runs that have a state of 'running' else False
  BOOL_SINGLE_RUN:
    description: True if there is only 1 run returned from the query else False
  NUM_FINISHED:
    description: The number of non-baseline runs with a state of 'finished'
  NUM_RUNNING:
    description: The number of non-baseline runs with a state of 'running'
  NUM_CRASHED:
    description: The number of non-baseline runs with a state of 'crashed'
  NUM_ABORTED:
    description: The number of non-baseline runs with a state of 'aborted'
  NUM_BASELINES:
    description: The number of baseline runs returned.
